C - More pointers, arrays and strings
 Amateur

 Your score will be updated as you progress.


Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file

Tasks
0. strcat
mandatory
Write a function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcat. Run man strcat to learn more.
  

1. strncat
mandatory
Write a function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
it will use at most n bytes from src; and
src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
Return a pointer to the resulting string dest
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strncat. Run man strncat to learn more.


2. strncpy
mandatory
Write a function that copies a string.

Prototype: char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
Your function should work exactly like strncpy

3. strcmp
mandatory
Write a function that compares two strings.

Prototype: int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
Your function should work exactly like strcmp
